# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect $unwind Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$unwind` operator.  The provided code shows how an incorrect use of `$unwind` can lead to unexpected document duplication and incorrect aggregation results.  The solution provides a correct implementation to avoid this issue.

## Problem

The `$unwind` stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to deconstruct arrays into individual documents.  However, if not used carefully with `$group`, it can lead to incorrect results when multiple matches exist in the joined collection.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates a corrected aggregation pipeline that addresses the problem of unexpected document duplication by strategically placing the `$group` stage to correctly handle the relationships between the collections.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a MongoDB instance and create two collections (`collectionA` and `collectionB`) with appropriate data
3. Run the `bug.js` script.  Observe the unexpected results.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script. Observe the corrected results.
