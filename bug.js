```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collectionB",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "foreignKey",
      as: "relatedData",
    },
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$relatedData",
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$_id",
      relatedData: { $push: "$relatedData" },
    }
  }
];

//This query can cause unexpected behavior if collectionB has multiple documents matching the foreignKey.
//The $unwind stage will duplicate documents from collectionA for each match in collectionB, resulting in incorrect aggregation.

//Incorrect aggregation results
